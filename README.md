# Data Cleaning
I sorted the whole table in ascending order of customer ID checked for duplicates and blank values.

Customer ID; The Customer ID was arranged order of number, I just filled the missing values with the appropriate ascending order.

Order ID The blank values were filled, I looked closely at the order and sequencing DC, DD, DY, DM noticed the pattern and filled in the blank values.

Age There were no blank values in the age table but there were  weird ages like 3100,280 (Typographical Error).I removed the zeros.
